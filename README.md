# Installing Anthos Service Mesh on GKE with ASM Terraform module.

## Prerequistes 

1. This tutorial has been tested on [Cloud Shell](https://shell.cloud.google.com) which comes preinstalled with [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk) and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) which are required to complete this tutorial.

2. It is recommended to start the tutorial in a fresh project since the easiest way to clean up once complete is to delete the project. See [here](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects) for more details.

## Deploy resources using Terraform

1. Define the environment variable and set project.

    ```
    export PROJECT=PROJECT_ID
    gcloud config set project ${PROJECT}
    ```

1. Create a working directory, clone this repo and switch to the appropriate branch

    ```bash
    mkdir ~/asm-tutorial && cd ~/asm-tutorial
    git clone https://github.com/alizaidis/terraform-asm-sample.git
    cd terraform-asm-sample
    git checkout az-2
    ```

1. Initialize, plan and apply Terraform to create VPC, Subnet, GKE cluster with private nodes and ASM. Provide the project ID for your Google Cloud project when the Terraform plan and apply steps ask for it.

    ```bash
    cd terraform
    terraform init
    terraform plan
    terraform apply
    ```

## Verify successful ASM installation

1. Verify that the GKE cluster membership to a Fleet was successful:

    ```bash
    gcloud container hub memberships list --project $PROJECT_ID
    ```

1. Inspect GKE cluster to verify that ASM was installed correctly. Start by getting cluster credentials.

    ```bash
    gcloud container clusters get-credentials "asm-cluster-1" --zone "us-central1-c" --project $PROJECT_ID
    ```

1. Inspect the status of controlplanerevision CustomResource.

    ```bash
    kubectl describe controlplanerevision asm-managed -n istio-system
    ```

    The output is similar to the following:

    ```

1. Review the status of the controlplanerevision custom resource named asm-managed, the `RECONCILED` field should be set to `True`.
    
    ```bash
    kubectl get controlplanerevisions -n istio-system
    ```

    The output is similar to the following:

    ```bash
            NAME          RECONCILED   STALLED   AGE
            asm-managed   True         False     14m
    ```

1. Review the `ConfigMaps` in the istio-system namespace.

    ```bash
    kubectl get configmaps -n istio-system
    ```

    The output is similar to the following:
 
    ```bash
        NAME                   DATA   AGE
        asm-options            1      20m
        env-asm-managed        3      8m2s
        istio-asm-managed      1      20m
        istio-gateway-leader   0      8m1s
        istio-leader           0      8m1s
        kube-root-ca.crt       1      20m
        mdp-eviction-leader    0      12m
    ```

## Clean up

1. The easiest way to prevent continued billing for the resources that you created for this tutorial is to delete the project you created for the tutorial. Run the following command from Cloud Shell and enter `y` when asked to confirm.

   ```bash
    gcloud projects delete $PROJECT_ID
    ```
